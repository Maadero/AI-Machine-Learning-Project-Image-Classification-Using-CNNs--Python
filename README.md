•
Developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for an image classification task, working with a dataset of 13,394 images across 10 classes.
•
Implemented data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning to improve classification accuracy.
•
Leveraged pre-trained models (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0) to enhance feature extraction and model performance.
•
Explored both Sequential and Functional API architectures for deep learning model development.
•
Applied normalisation, max pooling, and activation functions (ReLU, Softmax) to optimise learning and convergence.
•
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and overfitting diagnostics, improving test accuracy from 53.48% (baseline) to 99.52% (EfficientNetB0).
•
Conducted fine-tuning experiments, analysing the impact of unfreezing layers and adjusting learning rates for further optimisation.
